Rules explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Some extra things you can do:

* S - start/stop the cycle
* R - restart with random live cells setup
* C - clear the board (only dead cells)
* P - print current status to the console
* Q - quite the game

You can also prepare your own board init states by:
* stop the cycle (C)
* mark live cells by clicking on the board
* print the current state (P)
* copy the printed state from the terminal and paste to the TEMPLATES dictionary in the  [templates.py](https://github.com/owad/game-of-life/blob/master/templates.py) file
* restart the game (Q)

## Requirements:
* pygame

## How to run
Run ``python gameoflife.py`` command from the project's root.
