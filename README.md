# Game of life

Rules explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Some extra things you can do:

* S - start/stop the cycle
* R - restart with random live cells setup
* C - clear the board (only dead cells)
* P - print current status to the console
* Q - quite the game

You can also prepare your own board init states by:
* Stopping the cycle (C)
* marking live cells by clicking on the board
* printing the current state (P)
* copy/pating the printed state from the terminal to the templates.py TEMPLATES dict under 1 to 9 key
